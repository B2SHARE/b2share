=====================

About
=====

This document specifies how to build and install the OpenAIRE overlay on top
of Invenio. 

1) Install Invenio as usual (not too easy ;-). Be sure to create database the 
database tables as well with

    inveniocfg --update-all
    inveniocfg --create-tables

2) Install OpenAIRE overlay with the usual

    ./configure
    make
    sudo -u <apache user> make install
    sudo -u <apache user> make install-tables

Please note that if you are working with a source code checkout, you will need
to run the following commands first:

    aclocal && autoconf && automake -a
   

You will then need to add your configuration files.

After installing be sure to run:

    inveniocfg --update-all
    inveniocfg --migrate
