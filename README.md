Utility scripts for Invenio.

All that is here at the minute is a script for *re*installing Invenio. It
assumes that all dependencies are installed including mysql and the multitude
of python packages. Please be very careful if you use this script - it will
drop the database for any existing install and move the old Invenio directory
to a new location.
